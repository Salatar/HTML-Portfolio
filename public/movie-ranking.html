<h2>Top 3 Movies...by Salatar</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>Dune 2</h3>

<p>After struggling to stay awake during the first film, the Dune series really proved to be 
an extremely interesting and entertaining series with this addition, 
I can not wait for the final installment!!
</p>

<h3>Mad Max: Furiosa</h3>

<p>An amazing and entertaining origin story for Furiosa, I have a new found love and appreciation for 
the Mad Max saga!!
</p>

<h3>The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug</h3>

<p>Its been a while but a rewatch confirmed the second installment of the Hobbit trilogy was incredible.
I just love the scene where the dwarves are escaping the Elven kingdom in the barrels down the river 
being chased by orcs!!!
